**3.a** International Morse code is a representation of English alphabet and numbers marks by arrangement of dots, dashes and spaces. <br/>
Example : embsys 310 <br/>
e: **.** <br/>
m: **--** <br/>
b: **-...** <br/>
s: **...** <br/>
y: **-.--** <br/>
s: **...** <br/>

<br/>
3: **...--** <br/>
1: **.----** <br/>
0: **-----** <br/>

Lets assume a dot is 100ms long. Dashes are three times the duration of a dot, that is, 300ms for each dash. Each dash and dot within a letter are separated by a space, which is equivalent to the duration of one dot, that is, 100ms for each space. Each letter within a word are separated by a space, which is equivalent to the duration of three dots, that is, 300ms for each space. Each word is separated by a space, which is equivalent to the duration of seven dots, that is, 700ms for each space.

**3.b** Morse code was developed by Samuel F.B. Morse during 1830s. Eventually International Morse Code was devised by a conference of European nations in 1951.
