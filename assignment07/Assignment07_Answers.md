### 1
I was having issue with my project when following your example. Therefore, I didn't get far with this project.

When I was trying to save the stack configuration, I was supposed to get an error that I can't overwrite the default file. But I never got that error, and the system allowed a blank path. This kinda got me stuck, I tried to restart the project by starting from blank project, but nothing seemed to work.

I am uploading my project, maybe you can point out what I am doing wrong, or what setting.

ROM is occupying total of 172 bytes (code + data)

### 2.b
RAM is using 0 bytes but 0x2000 bytes are reserved for stack

### 2.c
Main.o file is using the most RAM.

### 2.d
